# 5/3/1 Rotation Program

This repository contains files for implementing a comprehensive 5/3/1 strength program with rotating squat and deadlift variations.

## Program Overview

- **4-day split**: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, OHP
- **Staggered 5/3/1 cycles**: Each lift follows its own 3-week cycle (no deload weeks)
- **Squat & Deadlift Variations**: 6 variations each (belted and unbelted options)
- **Paired movements**: Each main lift is paired with a complementary movement
- **Madcow-style 5×5**: Using the "middle percentage" weight from main work
- **Hypertrophy accessories**: Two blocks (A & B) of additional volume work

## Files in This Repository

1. **531-rotation-program.csv** - Main program design with section-by-section breakdown
2. **weight-calculator.csv** - Calculator for all lift variations and protocols
3. **workout-tracker-template.csv** - Templates for tracking your daily workouts
4. **README.md** - This overview file

## How to Use These Files

1. **Import to a Spreadsheet Program**:
   - Download the CSV files and open them in Excel, Google Sheets, etc.
   - Formulas will need to be added to make calculations automatic
   - CSV format ensures compatibility with any spreadsheet software

2. **Set Up Your Training Maxes**:
   - Enter your 1RMs in the weight-calculator.csv file
   - Each variation gets its own Training Max based on percentages
   - Use these TMs for all your lift calculations

3. **Follow the 12-Week Program**:
   - Use the staggered approach from 531-rotation-program.csv
   - Each lift follows its own 3-week protocol
   - Track progress using the workout-tracker-template.csv

4. **Manage Volume As Needed**:
   - The full program has extremely high volume (41-50 sets per session)
   - Consider reducing hypertrophy work to 3 sets instead of 5
   - Alternating Hypertrophy A and B blocks weekly is also an option

## Squat and Deadlift Rotations

### Squat Variations:
- High Bar

### Deadlift Variations:

## Weekly Workout Structure

Each workout follows this sequence:
1. Main lift (5/3/1 protocol) super-setted with paired movement
2. 5×5 supplemental work for both movements at "middle percentage"
3. Hypertrophy work (blocks A and B)

## Training Max Progression

- Each variation has its own TM
- Update after completing the 5/3/1+ week for that specific variation
- Upper body lifts: +5 lbs per cycle
- Lower body lifts: +10 lbs per cycle

## Important Notes

- This is an extremely high-volume program
- Consider starting with reduced volume and building up as you adapt
- Track your recovery carefully and adjust as needed
- The staggered approach distributes intensity across the week, avoiding multiple heavy days

Customize this program to your needs and recovery capacity. The CSV files are designed to be flexible templates that you can modify to fit your specific situation.
