# 5/3/1 Rotation Program

This repository contains a comprehensive 5/3/1 program with rotating variations for squats and deadlifts.

## Program Overview

- **4-day split**: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, OHP
- **Staggered 5/3/1 cycles**: Each lift follows its own 3-week cycle (no deload weeks)
- **Squat and Deadlift Variations**: 6 variations each (belted and unbelted options)
- **Paired movements**: Each main lift is paired with a complementary movement
- **Madcow-style 5Ã—5**: Using the "middle percentage" weight from main work
- **Hypertrophy accessories**: Two blocks (A & B) of additional volume work

## Volume Management
