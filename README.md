# 5/3/1 Rotation Program

This repository contains files for implementing a comprehensive 5/3/1 strength program with rotating squat and deadlift variations.

## Program Overview

- **4-day split**: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, OHP
- **Staggered 5/3/1 cycles**: Each lift follows its own 3-week cycle (no deload weeks)
- **Squat & Deadlift Variations**: 6 variations each (belted and unbelted options)
- **Paired movements**: Each main lift is paired with a complementary movement
- **Madcow-style 5×5**: Using the "middle percentage" weight from main work
- **Hypertrophy accessories**: Two blocks (A & B) of additional volume work

## How to Use This Program

1. **Download the CSV file** - The `531-rotation-program.csv` contains all program details
2. **Open in Excel/Google Sheets** - Import the CSV into your preferred spreadsheet program
3. **Fill in your 1RMs** - Enter your 1-rep max values in the Training Max Calculator section
4. **Follow the rotation schedule** - Use the 12-week program outline to know which variation to use each week
5. **Track your progress** - Record your weights and reps to ensure progressive overload

## Weekly Structure Example

Each workout follows this structure:
1. Main lift (5/3/1 protocol) super-setted with paired movement
2. 5×5 supplemental work for both movements
3. Hypertrophy work (blocks A and B)

## Volume Management

The program has high volume (41-50 sets per session). Consider:
- Starting with 3 sets instead of 5 for hypertrophy work
- Alternating Hypertrophy A and B blocks weekly
- Including a deload week every 6-8 weeks

## Important Notes

- Each variation has its own Training Max (TM)
- Update TMs after completing the 5/3/1+ week (+5lbs upper/+10lbs lower)
- Follow the staggered approach to distribute intensity across the week
- Track separate TMs for each squat and deadlift variation
