SECTION: VOLUME MANAGEMENT SUGGESTIONS,,,,,,
Approach,Description,When to Use,,,
Standard,Follow program as written (all sets),If recovery is good,,,
Moderate,Reduce hypertrophy work to 3 sets per exercise,If feeling moderately fatigued,,,
Low,Alternate between Hypertrophy A and B weekly,If recovery is compromised,,,
Minimal,Only perform main and 5×5 supplemental work,During high fatigue periods,,,
Deload,Use 60% of TM for all lifts for one week,Every 6-8 weeks,,,
,,,,,,
SECTION: PROGRAM NOTES,,,,,,
1. TM Updates: Each squat and deadlift variation has its own TM. Update after completing the 5/3/1+ week for that specific variation.,,,,,,
2. Progression: +5lbs for upper body lifts (bench, OHP), +10lbs for lower body (all squat and deadlift variations) per cycle.,,,,,,
3. Track all 12 different TMs (6 squat variations, 6 deadlift variations) separately.,,,,,,
4. Super-setting main lifts with paired movements makes efficient use of rest periods.,,,,,,
5. Total sets per day: 41-50 (consider reducing if recovery becomes an issue).,,,,,,
6. Adjust the number of hypertrophy sets based on your recovery capacity.,,,,,,
7. This program has extremely high volume - start conservatively and build up as you adapt.,,,,,,
